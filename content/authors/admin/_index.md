Wu Yihong (吴 奕竑) is a Ph.D. Candidate of Computer Science at the State Key Lab of CAD&CG in Zhejiang University, also a member of ZJU Interactive Data Group supervised by Prof. Wu.. My research interests include sports visualization, deep learning and data mining.

I received my bachelor degree in Software Engineering at Zhejiang University. Now I'm working hard to lay a solid foundation of deep learning and visualization, and learn to think individually as a researcher.
